This submodule defines the two main statistical models to be used in the simulations.
<ol>
  <li><b>MultinomialLogisticRegression</b> is a multinomial logistic regression model that allows testing in a 
  smooth and strongly convex setting.</li>
  <li><b>NeuralNetwork</b> is a simple ReLU-activated neural network with one hidden layer. This allows testing in
  a nonconvex scenario.</li>
</ol>
